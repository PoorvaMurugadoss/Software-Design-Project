# Software-Design-Project
For our project we used flutter to create a phone application “TELEMED”. Flutter is an opensource framework by Google for building beautiful, natively compiled, multi-platform
applications from a single codebase. Our application is for android users but we can also
create the same for iOS. Flutter also made us create the website version for the same.
